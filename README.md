# Influxer
A C# console application to parse log files (currently only Windows Perfmon format) and push data to Influx for later visualization.

[InfluxDB][1] is a very nice time series database, and is supported by many data visualizers (mainly [grafana][2]). But if you have other tools which are producing the data in csv format (mainly PerfMon in windows, or enterprise reporting tools) which are not designed for Influx era, you will have to develop own tools to pull from one tool and to push to other.

Meet Influxer, a small C# console application, which will take any generic csv file or standard PerfMon csv log, and upload it to any Influx instance.

        Valid switches are
    -influx <url>       :   Influx DB Url
    -dbName <name>      :   Influx DB Name (will be created if not exists)
    -uname <username>   :   Influx DB User name
    -pass <password>    :   Influx DB Password
    -tags <tags>        :   Tags to be passed with every value, key value pairs, space will be converted to _
    -input <filename>   :   Input File CSV generated by PerfMon
    -seperator <char>   :   Column Separators default is ,
    -timeformat <format>:   Time format used by PerfMon (default MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss.fff)
    -format <format>    :   CSV File format PerfMon(default) and Generic are supported. For generic TableName is required
    -table <table name> :   Influx Table name needed for generic format only
    -filter <filter>    :   supported:measurement, field, columns.
    -columns <columns>  :   Comma separated list of columns from input files
    -filter-measurement or field is to restrict the input file to only measurements or fields that already present in the database
    -filter-columns is to restrict to only few columns from the input irrespective of existing data in database
    -columns will be ignored in other cases. Replace any inline commas in columns names with a space!

In case of Perfmon logs, the measurements are created at a CounterObject level, and each counters in those objects become fields. The Host name is added as tag. 

In case of generic CSV, first column should have a timestamp, and each column will be loaded as a field in the measurement (similar to tables in SQL world) passed as table name.
